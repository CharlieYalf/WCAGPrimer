# 1.4.1 Use of Color

## Summary
Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

[Understanding 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html)

## How to Test

1. Visual Inspection:
   - Identify all instances where color is used to convey information
   - Verify that there is an additional visual indicator (icons, patterns, text)
   - Check form fields for error states
   - Review links within text blocks

2. Tools:
   - Use grayscale mode in browser dev tools
   - Color contrast analyzers
   - Screen capture in monochrome

## Common Mistakes

1. Using only red/green colors for success/error states
2. Indicating required form fields only with color
3. Using color alone to distinguish links within text
4. Charts/graphs that rely solely on color to distinguish data
5. Status indicators using only color differences

| 1.4.1-1 | Form error states | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | Error is indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify errors in form fields | Do not rely on color alone to indicate errors, also add an icon/text to indicate errors |
| 1.4.1-2 | Required form fields | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | Required form fields are indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify required form fields | Do not rely on color alone to indicate required form fields, also add an icon/text to indicate required form fields |
| 1.4.1-3 | Links in text | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | Links are indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify links | Do not rely on color alone to indicate links, use underline or other non-color indicator to distinguish links |
| 1.4.1-4 | Charts/graphs | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | Data is indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify data | Do not rely on color alone to indicate data, use patterns/shapes to distinguish data |
| 1.4.1-5 | Status indicators | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | Status is indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify status | Do not rely on color alone to indicate status, use icons/text to indicate status |

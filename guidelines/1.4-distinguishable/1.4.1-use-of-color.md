# 1.4.1 Use of Color

## Summary
Ensure that color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

[Understanding 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html)

## WCAG failures at a glance

1. Using only red/green colors for success/error states
2. Indicating required form fields only with color
3. Using color alone to distinguish links within text
4. Charts/graphs that rely solely on color to distinguish data
5. Status indicators using only color differences


## How to test

### 1. Visual inspection:
   - Identify all instances where color is used to convey information
   - Verify that there is an additional visual indicator (icons, patterns, text)
   - Check form fields for error states
   - Review links within text blocks

### 2. Tools:
   - Grayscale (Browser System Settings)
   - Windows:
     1. Open Settings
     2. Go to "Ease of Access" > "Color filters" 
     3. Turn on "Color filters"
     4. Select "Grayscale"
   - MacOS:
     1. Open System Preferences
     2. Go to "Accessibility" > "Display"
     3. Check "Use grayscale"

| Test ID | Finding title | Success criteria | WCAG level | Disabilities affected | Requires involvement of | Impact | Description | Why it matters | Solution Suggestion |
|---------|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1.4.1-1 | Form error relies on color alone | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | On the [PAGE] the [FORM FIELD/s] error is indicated using color alone without an additional visual indicator | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify errors in form fields | Do not rely on color alone to indicate errors, also add an icon/text to indicate errors |
| 1.4.1-2 | Required form fields rely on color alone | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | On the [PAGE] the required form fields are indicated using color alone | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify required fields | Do not rely on color alone to indicate required fields, also add an icon/text to indicate required fields |
| 1.4.1-3 | Links in text rely on color alone | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | On the [PAGE] the links are indicated using color alone without an additional visual indicator | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify links | Do not rely on color alone to indicate links, also add an underline or other non-color indicator to indicate links |
| 1.4.1-4 | Charts/graphs rely on color alone | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | On the [PAGE] the charts/graphs are indicated using color alone without an additional visual indicator | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify data | Do not rely on color alone to indicate data, use patterns/shapes to distinguish data |
| 1.4.1-5 | Status indicators rely on color alone | 1.4.1 | A | Low Vision | Designer, Dev | Moderate | On the [PAGE] the status indicators are indicated using color alone without an additional visual indicator | Users who have difficulty distinguishing color may not be able to identify status | Do not rely on color alone to indicate status, also add icons/text to indicate status |

### 1.4.1-1 Form error states
Confirm that form errors do not rely on color alone to indicate errors and instead also use an icon/text to indicate errors.

#### How to check

1. Turn on grayscale mode (see [Tools](#2-tools))
2. Submit a form with all fields empty.
3. Submit a form with an incorrect field.

#### What to check
1. Ensure all error states are distinguishable from the other states in grayscale; ensure the error states are not only indicated by color.

### 1.4.1-2 Required form fields
Confirm that required form fields are not only indicated by color and instead also use an icon/text to indicate they are required.

#### How to check

1. Turn on grayscale mode (see [Tools](#2-tools))
2. View all form fields that are required.

#### What to check
1. Ensure all form fields that are required are distinguishable from the other form fields in grayscale; ensure the required form fields are not only indicated by color.

### 1.4.1-3 Links in text 
Confirm that links are not only indicated by color and instead also use an underline or other non-color indicator to indicate they are links.

#### How to check

1. Turn on grayscale mode (see [Tools](#2-tools))
2. View all links in the page.

#### What to check
1. Ensure all links are distinguishable from the other text in grayscale; ensure the links are not only indicated by color.

### 1.4.1-4 Charts/graphs 
Confirm that charts/graphs do not rely on color alone to indicate important information and relationships between data. 

#### How to check

1. Turn on grayscale mode (see [Tools](#2-tools))
2. View all charts/graphs in the page.

#### What to check
1. Ensure all elements within the charts/graphs are distinguishable from the other elements in grayscale; ensure the charts/graphs are not only indicated by color.

### 1.4.1-5 Status indicators
Confirm that status indicators do not rely on color alone to indicate status and instead also use an icon/text to indicate status.  

#### How to check
1. Turn on grayscale mode (see [Tools](#2-tools))
2. Complete a task that changes the status of the page and displays a status indicator.

#### What to check
1. Ensure the current state of the status indicators is still distinguishable from the other states in grayscale; ensure the status indicators are not only indicated by color.
